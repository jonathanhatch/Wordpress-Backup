<h2>Social Innovators Need Apply</h2>
You don't need 501(c)(3) status to do good work. Fiscal sponsorship allows your organization to take tax-deductible funding without having to seek nonprofit status. All you need is a solid plan and a good heart.
<h2>Are you a good fit?</h2>
We like people who have unique ideas and a great plan. Are you that person?
<h2>Projects we have sponsored</h2>
We've funded a number of different projects:
<ul>
 	<li>Project 1</li>
 	<li>Project 2</li>
 	<li>Project 3</li>
</ul>
