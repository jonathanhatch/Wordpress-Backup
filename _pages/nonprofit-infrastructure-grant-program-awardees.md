<strong>Minneapolis, Minn., January 25, 2018</strong> – Propel Nonprofits, in partnership with the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development, has awarded $900,000 to 21 culturally led nonprofit organizations for infrastructure funding. The intent of these grants is to support the missions of small, culturally led organizations by strengthening their internal operations.

“We believe that increasing the capacity of small organizations which work with historically underserved cultural communities helps position them for greater impact in their community,” said Mario Hernandez, Strategic Services Director for Propel Nonprofits.

“You can’t carry out your mission if you don’t invest in core mission support – efficient technology, administration, and financial systems; staff development; new collaborations; and other internal supports,” said Kate Barr, President &amp; CEO of Propel Nonprofits. There was a strong demand for this pilot funding round from across the state.

In addition to grant funding, awarded organizations will also receive ongoing technical assistance from Propel Nonprofits regarding financial administration.
