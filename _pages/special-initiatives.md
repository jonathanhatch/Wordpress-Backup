<h2>Healthy Nonprofits, Healthy Communities - Itasca County</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Propel Nonprofits helps nonprofits in Itasca County strengthen their financial management, develop strong boards of directors, and learn to forge collaborations with other organizations to serve the community more effectively. This initiative provides nonprofits several opportunities to identify and act on their highest priorities for capacity building. </span>
<h3>Learning Sessions</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Each year the </span><b>Healthy Nonprofits, Healthy Communities</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> participants take part in a learning series. Recent topics have included Sustainability, The Performance Imperative, and Revenue Archetypes. Sessions are free and typically take place from </span><b>8:30 am to noon at Timberlake Lodge in Grand Rapids</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Networking and ample time for discussion are built into every session. You can attend each session on its own or attend all in a series. </span>
<h3>Webinars</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Propel Nonprofits brings our training to you virtually! All are welcome to join Propel Nonprofits for any of our free webinars – see a list of <a href="http://propelnonprofits.org/upcoming-trainings/">upcoming webinars</a>.</span>
<h3>Consulting for Organizational Priorities</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every nonprofit organization has goals and plans to deliver its programs in the community and strengthen its organization. No one knows better than the nonprofit’s leaders what types of projects are most important to move to the next level. Working with a core group of experienced consultants, your nonprofit will focus on a project that will help you move forward. Our consulting services projects focus on strategic planning, such as board development, strategic planning, succession planning, and finance/sustainability.  </span>
<h3>Executive Director Cohort</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016 we added the opportunity for Executive Directors to be part of a cohort that meets for lunch following each of the learning sessions for a deeper dive with their peers into the topics covered that morning. The next cohort is being planned for fall 2018 – check back here in 2018 as more details become available.   </span>
<h3>Open Office Hours</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In many instances nonprofits need a quick response for advice and resources on organizational issues when they arise. These situations often don’t require a full consulting project or scope, but rather easy access to an experienced professional with knowledge, access to resources, and availability. Call us at 612.249.6700 to schedule an Open Office Hours consultation by phone.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>
