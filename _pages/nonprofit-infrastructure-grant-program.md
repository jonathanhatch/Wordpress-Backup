The Nonprofit Infrastructure Grant Program (NIGP) is aimed at supporting the missions of small, culturally led organizations by supporting the strengthening of their infrastructure. Increasing the capacity of small organizations which focus on historically underserved cultural communities helps position them for greater impact in their community. The Nonprofit Infrastructure Grant Program will provide grants to small Minnesota nonprofits and provide ongoing technical assistance in the area of financial administration. <a href="http://propel.stpaulmedia.net/blog/addressing-minnesota-paradox/">Read Kate Barr's blog post</a> for more background on the Nonprofit Infrastructure Grant Program.
