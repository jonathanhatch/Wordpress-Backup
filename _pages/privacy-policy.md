Propel website users are not required to provide any information when they visit our site. However, we may ask for some or all of the following information when users fill out online applications or inquiry forms, register for events, or sign up for our newsletters:

<h2>How We Use Information</h2>
We use your personal information to provide you with personalized service; to send you email alerts; to answer your requests; to process your online applications and inquiries; etc. You may unsubscribe from receiving emails from us sent via MailChimp. If you wish to do so, simply follow the instructions found at the end of the email. Even if you unsubscribe, we may still contact you for informational, transactional, account-related, or similar purposes.

We may also use your information to track visitors to our website. This lets us see which of our features are the most popular so we can better serve our users' needs. It also lets us provide aggregate data about our traffic (not identifying you personally, but showing how many visitors used which features, for example).
<h2>Email Privacy</h2>
Propel Nonprofits does not sell or rent email addresses to anyone outside the organization.
<h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
It is our policy not to share your information with third parties. We do reserve the right to share your information with third parties in the following limited circumstances:
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">In order to protect the legal rights, safety, and security of Propel Nonprofits;</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To enforce our Terms of Use;</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To comply with or respond to law enforcement or legal process or a request for cooperation by a government or other entity, whether or not legally required.</li>
</ul>
We may also disclose certain aggregate website usage and demographic information that does not describe or identify individual users.

We use Google Analytics to track behavior on our website to make sure it’s as helpful and functional as possible. No personally identifying data is included in this type of data tracking and we abide by the <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html">Google Analytics Terms of Service</a>.
<h2>Data Security</h2>
We have procedures in place to help protect against theft, loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or destruction of the information you provide to us. No data transmission or storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit or disclose to us and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your information. In the event of a breach, we will notify you via email as soon as we can.
<h2>Third Party Sites and Services</h2>
Propel utilizes third party vendors <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full">PayPal</a>, <a href="http://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/">MailChimp</a>, <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/security/">EventBrite</a>, <a href="https://www.formassembly.com/privacy-policy/">FormAssembly</a>, <a href="https://www.readytalk.com/privacy-policy">ReadyTalk</a>, <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/privacy-policy/">SurveyMonkey</a>, for ecommerce, newsletters, ticketing, inquiries, webinars, and surveys, respectively.
