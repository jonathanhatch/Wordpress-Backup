If you read this blog you probably know that Propel Nonprofits (formerly Nonprofits Assistance Fund and MAP for Nonprofits) has an extensive <a href="http://propel.stpaulmedia.net/resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online library</a> of articles, guides, tools, and examples to help nonprofits plan and manage finances. The resource that is always at the top of the list when we review statistics about monthly views and downloads in a guide we wrote six years ago about the <a href="http://propel.stpaulmedia.net/resources/10-step-budgeting-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nonprofit budgeting process</a>. The guide lays out a step-by-step process with ample time for information gathering, input from various players within the organization, goal alignment, and levels of approval and review. The more that staff participate in the budget process, the guide suggests, the more buy in and support the final budget will have.

It sounds so good – but it doesn’t work anymore. Just as process intensive strategic planning is making way for more flexible and adaptable strategic road maps or frameworks, our systematic budget process needs to adapt to the volatility and uncertainty of the times. Budgets need to breathe, flex, and bend as the opportunities and unknown challenges are presented.

Nonprofits still need to develop financial plans (budgets) and will continue to follow a familiar sequence:
<ol>
 	<li>Assess the financial condition at the starting point.</li>
 	<li>Agree on the central goals for the organization and program delivery and outputs.</li>
 	<li>Establish budget guidelines needed for consistency.</li>
 	<li>Assign roles, responsibilities, and timeline for budget development.</li>
 	<li>Gather information and research to improve assumptions.</li>
 	<li>Compile drafts and evaluate how well the goals will be achieved.</li>
 	<li>Re-assess goals and priorities in order to maintain a balanced or surplus budget.</li>
 	<li>Approve the budget.</li>
 	<li>Communicate and monitor activities compared to budget.</li>
 	<li>Hold breath each month or quarter to see how well you did.</li>
</ol>
That last step is a sign that the sequence needs to change. The first six steps haven’t changed but the rest of the process is too static and final. Budgets are built on assumptions, and the level of uncertainty keeps increasing. How reliable can our assumptions be when budgets are developed 12 to 18 months in advance?

Developing a living, breathing budget will allow for more uncertainty by adjusting the process. Here is a revised version for the second half, including steps 7 – 12:
<ul>
 	<li>Re-assess goals and priorities in order to generate a budget with the net results needed for overall health and stability (which could be a surplus, breakeven, or deficit).</li>
 	<li>Approve the budget framework, goals, and target for net result.</li>
 	<li>Authorize regular financial review, forecasts, and scenario planning.</li>
 	<li>Monitor actual results, gather new information, and update assumptions.</li>
 	<li>Maintain rolling forecasts based on the timeliest information.</li>
 	<li>Report results, forecasts, and progress towards meeting financial and strategic goals.</li>
</ul>
In this process, budget variances reports are useful to identify the areas where the assumptions need to be re-considered. Was the difference the result of internal decisions or actions, or were there external changes or opportunities? This process is complex and requires continuous input and decision making. New tools need to be created and learned, including scenario planning. The roles and authority required are different from a “set in stone budget”. Don’t be concerned that your whole budget will change every month – in actual practice there will be many components of the budget that are fairly certain and fixed for the year. But think about the times in the past when you’ve had to explain all the variances and changes from the budget that was approved months earlier and based on assumptions made long ago. Would your financial plan be more useful if it was built for adaptability?

This idea is outlined well in the <a href="http://www.nonprofitquarterly.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nonprofit Quarterly</a> article <a href="http://www.nonprofitquarterly.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19126:an-executive-directors-guide-to-fi-nancial-leadership&amp;catid=153:features&amp;Itemid=336" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Executive Director’s Guide to Financial Leadership</a> by my co-author Jeanne Bell.
